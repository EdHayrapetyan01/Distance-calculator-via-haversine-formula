## About the App

The app should consist of two pages: the search form (home page) and the search results.
A home page with a search form that requires input for City of origin, Intermediate cities (which can be added/removed), City of destination, Date of the trip, and Number of passengers. The City of origin and City of destination are searchable dropdowns with a list of cities that are requested and searched asynchronously with a loading indication. The Date of the trip should be in the future and the Number of passengers should be a number greater than 0.

## Technologies

React, Typescript, react router dom, styled components, material ui, ESLint, prettier

## Approach

Here i used client side rendering, and for the routing system I used react-router-dom, opted to use Day.js for handling dates, as Moment.js has become outdated, in the app I used the kebab-case naming style for classnames, and calculates distances between cities using their coordinates and the Haversine formula.
